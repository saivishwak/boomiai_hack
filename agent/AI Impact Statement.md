**AI Impact Statement – Privacy-First Distributed Intelligent Patient Monitoring & ECG Analysis**

Our solution integrates **distributed AI agents** with **local, privacy-preserving reasoning** to enable secure and intelligent patient monitoring across hospital networks. A lightweight, fine-tuned **LLM** trained on **ECG waveforms** and **clinical terminology** runs entirely on the **hospital’s local edge infrastructure**, ensuring that **sensitive patient data never leaves the network**.

The system combines **real-time patient monitoring** and **ECG analysis**:

* A **local camera/ECG agent** detects critical events (e.g., abnormal rhythms, falls, or distress) on-device.

* A **reasoning agent** processes nurse queries and delivers **actionable clinical insights** instantly.

* To ensure **accuracy and safety**, outputs are restricted to **verified medical knowledge**, enhanced with **rule-based guardrails**, and require **nurse confirmation** before updating patient records.

By processing all data locally, the system achieves **zero data leakage**, full **HIPAA/GDPR compliance**, and **cloud-free scalability**. Hospitals benefit from **faster diagnoses**, **reduced costs**, and **enhanced patient trust**.

This approach sets a new benchmark for **ethical AI in healthcare**, demonstrating how **distributed agents** and **on-device intelligence** can deliver **life-saving insights** while upholding the **highest standards of privacy and security**.
